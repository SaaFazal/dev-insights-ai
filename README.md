# Developer Insights using AI and Machine Learning

This project applies the **CRISP-DM framework** to the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey to uncover patterns in developer income and work attributes using **clustering** and **classification algorithms**.

> 🔍 Predicting high-income developers based on education, experience, and job role.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a complete data science pipeline from data cleaning to deployment-ready machine learning models:

- Business and data understanding using CRISP-DM
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Clustering developers into personas using KMeans + PCA
- Predicting high-income developers using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - k-NN
  - Voting Classifier (Ensemble)
